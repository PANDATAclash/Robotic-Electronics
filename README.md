This project contains our work for the Electronics for Robotics course (Minor Mobile Robotics). The focus of the assignment is designing and validating a low-level motor controller that can be used in robotic applications. It combines electronics hardware (power stage, sensing, power supply, interfaces) with embedded software on an ESP32 (MicroPython) to control a 12V brushed DC motor with encoder feedback, measure current/voltage, and implement communication with a high-level controller via serial (UART) and WiFi/TCP. The workflow emphasizes “learning by doing”: circuit design and component selection, PCB design in EasyEDA, and structured unit/integration testing of both hardware and firmware.
